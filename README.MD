This is a recreation of a minigame I never ended up finishing due to me being easily side-tracked. 
And this time I'm making sure that I'm following the original notes I made.

####Public Notes
There are more, these are the ones I am choosing to release
* 8 player game and 16 players in teams (x2 per team)
* Different modes (teams, normal)
* Natural regen disabled - need pots/golden apples to regenerate health
* Dead players go into a spectator mode
* Players may choose projectile trails (for snowballs, rods etc)
* When a player is killed they drop a skull
* Skulls can be used to buy equipment and to buy regeneration
* Multiple "balanced" kits

####Kits
Current kits are as follows:
* Armorsmith
* Armorer
* Baseballer [Replaced by Fisherman]
* Default
* Fisherman
* Knight
* Pyro
* Scout
