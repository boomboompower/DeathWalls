This is a recreation of a minigame I never ended up finishing. 
And this time I'm making sure that I'm following the production notes.

####Public Notes
There are more, these are the ones I am choosing to release
* `8 player game and 16 in teams`
* `Different modes (teams, normal etc)`
* `Natural regen disabled - need pots/gapples`
* `Dead players go into specator mode`
* `Players may choose projectile trails`
* `When a player is killed they drop a skull`
* `Skulls can be used to buy equipment and regeneration`
